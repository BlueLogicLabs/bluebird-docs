# API

:::info

This feature needs a Pro plan subscription.

:::

Pro users can use the same set of APIs that powers the Web version. Generate a token at **Settings->Data->API** and include it in the `Authorization` header when making requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-token
```

The APIs aren't documented yet - but feel free to open devtools and take a look at the network requests.

:::warning

Please do not use your cookies to make API requests.
