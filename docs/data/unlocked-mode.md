# Unlocked mode

We [keep your data safe](/terms/privacy), but we understand that *some data is more sensitive than others* and a second layer of protection is needed besides the sign-in state - so there is an **Unlocked mode** that specifically enables access to sensitive data for a short period.

Windi will send a verification link to your email address, and you can use it to activate Unlocked mode on the current session for 60 minutes.

Features protected by Unlocked mode:

- [Version history](/data/version-history)
- [API](/data/api) (token generation)
