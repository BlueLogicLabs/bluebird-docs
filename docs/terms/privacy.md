# Legal basis for the processing of personal data

Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing operations involving personal data, Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis. 

When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures. 

Insofar as processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis. 

In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make processing of personal data necessary, Art. 6 (1) (d) GDPR serves as the legal basis. 

If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.

## General technical organizational measures

BlueLogic LLC has taken a variety of security measures to protect personal information to an appropriate extent and adequately. All information held by BlueLogic LLC is protected by physical, technical, and procedural measures that limit access to the information to specifically authorised persons in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The BlueLogic LLC Platform is behind a software firewall to prevent access from other networks connected to the Internet. In addition, only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. These employees are trained in security and privacy practices and treat your information confidentially.

## Secure transfer of your data.

In order to best protect the data, we store against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorized persons, we use appropriate technical and organizational security measures. The security levels are continuously reviewed in cooperation with security experts and adapted to new security standards.

The exchange of data to and from our Platform is always encrypted. We offer HTTPS as the transmission protocol for our Platform, in each case using the current encryption protocols.

In addition, we offer our users content encryption as part of the contact forms and for applications. The decryption of this data is only possible for us. In addition, there is the option of using alternative communication channels (e.g., the postal service).

## Data processing in the context of our service provision

The protection of your data is particularly important to us in the performance of our services. We therefore only want to process as much personal data (for example, your name, address, e-mail address) as is absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, we rely on the processing of certain personal data, in order to fulfil our contractual obligations to you or to carry out pre-contractual measures. This processing of personal data, will always be carried out in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## Administration, financial accounting, office organization, contact management.

We process data in the context of administrative tasks as well as organization of our operations, financial accounting and compliance with legal obligations, such as archiving. In this regard, we process the same data that we process in the course of providing our contractual services. The processing bases are Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR, Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Customers, interested parties, business partners and website visitors are affected by the processing. The purpose and our interest in the processing lies in the administration, financial accounting, office organization, archiving of data, i.e., tasks that serve the maintenance of our business activities, performance of our tasks and provision of our services. The deletion of data with regard to contractual services and contractual communication corresponds to the data mentioned in these processing activities.

In this context, we disclose or transfer data to the tax authorities, consultants, such as tax advisors or auditors, as well as other fee offices and payment service providers.

Furthermore, based on our business interests, we store information on suppliers, event organizers and other business partners, e.g., for the purpose of contacting them at a later date. This data, most of which is company-related, is generally stored permanently.

## Information in the context of the use of the website

Such cookies register information about your computer's navigation on our Platform (pages selected, day, time and duration of use, etc.). A cookie is downloaded via a browser the first time you visit a website. The next time you visit this website with the same device, the browser checks whether a corresponding cookie is present (i.e., contains the website name).

Our website also uses cookies to make it easier to use and to provide you with content tailored to your information needs. 

You cannot be personally identified from any of the information we collect. The use of the cookies we use is necessary in order to be able to provide the online offer of BlueLogic LLC  at all and, moreover, to be able to optimize it on an ongoing basis.

Our legitimate interest is to provide visitors to our Platform with a functioning online service and to make visiting and using the website as pleasant and efficient as possible.

## Storage period and deletion

We store your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfil the intended purpose (e.g., contract fulfilment, answering your enquiries) or for as long as legal retention periods make storage necessary. As long as legal storage obligations, such as tax and commercial law regulations, or other justified reasons within the meaning of Art. 17 (3) of the GDPR prevent the deletion of your personal data, we will restrict the processing of your data; your data will then be deleted in accordance with the legal regulations.

## Transfer of personal data

BlueLogic LLC will not sell, rent or otherwise transfer your personal data to third parties. We will transfer your data to third parties if you have consented to this in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 a) GDPR, or in the following cases:

Contractors: BlueLogic LLC may engage other companies and individuals in certain cases to fulfil its obligations to its customers on its behalf. This may involve sharing your data with these third parties in order to provide products or services to you. Examples include customer service, payment data processing and marketing support. In these cases, data is transferred to such service providers and contractors (such as payment service providers, advertising providers, technical service providers) for the purpose of fulfilling the contract in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 b) GDPR.

It goes without saying that BlueLogic LLC ensures that the respective service provider guarantees data security before passing on personal data. BlueLogic LLC will therefore only commission companies that can guarantee secure and proper data processing based on their qualifications and their technical and organizational capabilities.

If you wish to object to certain data processing over which we have an influence, please contact us. We will then examine your objection.

You have the right to free information about the data stored about you at any time. In addition, you have the right to correct incorrect data, if necessary to delete your personal data and to restrict data processing.

In the latter case, you have a general right of objection, which will be implemented by us without giving reasons arising from your particular situation (Art. 21 (2) GDPR). If you object on grounds arising from your particular situation, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims (Art. 21 (1) GDPR).

Insofar as you provide us with personal data and we process this data on the basis of your consent, you may freely revoke the corresponding consent at any time with effect for the future.

If you provide us with data relating to you and we process this data on the basis of your consent or for the performance of a contract, you may also demand that we provide you with this data in a structured, common and machine-readable format or that we transfer this data to another controller, insofar as this is technically possible (so-called right to data portability).
