# Save from Telegram

Sometimes it would be nice to take notes quickly without needing to open a web app - so Planet supports saving notes directly from Telegram.

Go to **Settings->Connection->Telegram** and follow the instructions to set up the connection. Notes saved from Telegram are **private** by default.
