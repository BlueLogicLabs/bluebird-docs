# URL relations

URL relations are a kind of automatic connections between notes (compared to manual connections: [bidirectional links](/taking-notes/bidirectional-links) and [tags](/taking-notes/tags)). Paste a non-Windi URL in your new note, and the two-level connection of domain + path will be visualized in [Graph view](/taking-notes/graph).
