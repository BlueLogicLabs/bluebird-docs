# Taking Notes

**Write**: Note down your thoughts directly on the web app, through our Telegram bot, or even on your paper notebook. We help you bring them together.

**Connect**: Bidirectional links, nested hashtags, network graphs, and automatic image analysis.

**Share**: Use the same tools for organizing private notes - bidirectional links and network graphs work across the user boundary.

You don't need to have a structure in mind before writing. Just focus on ideas; the structure will emerge.
