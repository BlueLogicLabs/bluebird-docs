## About this site

Welcome to Windi's documentation site! This site contains materials about Windi's features and design rationales, and we hope you will find them useful.

If you:

- think a feature/property of the system should be documented but is missing
- found a bug
- want to share how you use Windi

you can discuss on Discord, [file an issue](https://github.com/BlueLogicLabs/windi-docs/issues), or [send a pull request](https://github.com/BlueLogicLabs/windi-docs/pulls).
